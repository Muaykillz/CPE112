# K-Nearest Neighbor
A simple Machine learning algorithm that used to estimate class or cluster something with nearest points

## Time Complexity of this algo is O(knd)
When **k** is number of nearest neighbor in area.
**n** is number of row in dataset.
and **d** is dimension or features of dataset.
